I want a web app,which can automatically accumulate the daily papers of any specified domain in arxiv website.The user can input the interested domains, and set the update interval(how often to get paper list from arxiv).Then the app can search the arxiv under the domains and list the papers title,abstract and link in a diagram.And the user can use filter to check the papers list under different domain.
